# Sign-Language-Translation
This model is a combination between two models. The first one is [Stochastic CSLR] (https://github.com/zheniu/stochastic-cslr) which is used to extract glosses from the video frames. Then the [Transformer] (https://github.com/kayoyin/transformer-slt) is used to translate glosses to text.
